There are four sprites
  1. Cannon
  2. Projectile
  3. Target (s?)
  4. PID SLIDER

Sprites have the following functions and characteristics
  1. Cannon:
    1.1 Given a mouse pointer location, moves towards target angle
        1.1.1 Mouse Pointer must be in "Cannon Area" and not in "PID SLIDER"
        1.1.2 Moves to 0 position when pointer goes into "PID Slider Area"
    1.2 Given space bar key press, fires
    1.3 Has rotational inertia 
    1.4 Modeled as a motor driven load
    1.5 Position is based on PID loop (tracker)
        1.5.1 Loop Variables: 
          SP - Current Mouse pointer position derived angle
          PV - Current Cannon Angle
          CV - Motor Voltage
          MV - Motor Speed
    1.6? PID Loop Parameters can be adjusted with a slider or entered as numbers
    1.7? Has noise in sensing and in actuation
    1.8 Positioned centrally in page
    
  2. Projectile
    2.1 Is projected when Cannon fires (1.2)
    2.2 Moves off in fired direction (1.1) 
      2.2.1 At speed x and slows down as it gets further away from cannon (air resistance)
    2.3 If it hits a target, explodes and gives a point
    2.5 If it hits an edge, flies away and respawns in Cannon
  
3. Targets (?): 
    3.1 Look like planes, drones, etc.
    3.2 Do fly by of the area, slowish, getting faster
